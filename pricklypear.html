<h4> The Story of Prickly Pear</h4>
<hr>
<p>
 Prickly Pear has flat green pads with sharp spines. In the summertime, he grows bright yellow flowers that become juicy red fruit he gives to his cousins, the cute little insects.<br><br>
 <br></p>
He seems scary, but is so generous and kind. “Why wear armor if you give away candy?” asks the neighborhood squirrels. "We can't climb you because you poke at us!" “To keep myself safe while still sharing,” says Prickly Pear, holding fruit for the locals.
<br></br>
Coyotes, Javelinas, and people eat the Prickly Pear's fruit. Seeds travel far in full bellies, then rest in new soil. Pads root easily if they fall to the ground.
<br></br> Prickly Pear smiles. “Strength and generosity can live together.” Community is protecting yourself and being kind at the same time.
