<h4> The Story of Moses In The Cradle</h4>
<hr>
<p>
At the base of gorgeous green-and-purple leaves, small white flowers rest in stillness inside Moses's purple cups. A child kneels down to take a closer look. “It looks like someone tucked them into bed!”
 <br></p>
The flowers whisper, “We sleep safely here. Moses's bracts cradle us like a baby gets cradled to rest. 
<br></br>
Bees buzz close, landing in the purple beds. They sip the white flowers' nectar, brushing pollen from one to another “Visitors are welcome here,” says the plant.
The child smiles. “So you nurture yourself and you share.” Moses in the Cradle sways gently. “That’s how we grow together.” Community is creating shelter where life can rest, bloom, and shared to everyone!
