<h4> The Story of Autumn Sage</h4>
<hr>
<p>
When summer ends and most flowers grow tired, Autumn Sage begins her show. Bright red trumpets bloom just as the air turns crisp along the path.
<br><br>
 Hummingbirds race to her. “Everyone else is quiet,” they say. “But you’re still singing.” “I saved my song for now,” Sage replies, swaying in the cool light.
 <br></p>
She offers nectar when other flowers have closed. The birds sip gratefully, carrying pollen from trumpet to trumpet. Tiny bees join the chorus, buzzing soft and low.
<br></br>
Why bloom so late?” asks the grass nearby. “Because friends need food in every season,” Sage answers. “Community means sharing at the moment it matters most.”
