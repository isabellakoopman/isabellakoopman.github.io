<h4> The Story of The Black Oak</h4>
<hr>
<p>
Black Oak is a tall, strong tree. In fall, her branches drop shiny brown acorns. They are like little cookies in tough shells, hidden under crunchy leaves. Squirrels, deer, and even blue jays come running when the acorns fall. Everyone knows this oak shares food each year.
<br><br>
“Can I have one?” asks the squirrel. “Of course,” says Black Oak. He stuffs three in his cheeks, saving them for winter. “Me too?” asks the deer. “Yes,” says the oak. Acorns crunch like popcorn under her teeth. Even the smallest mouse gets a bite.
<br><br>
“Why do you give away so much?” asks a breeze. “Because I have enough,” says the oak. Her branches sway like arms. “Community is when one tree feeds a whole neighborhood.” The animals curl up to rest. The oak’s bakery is always open, year after year.
